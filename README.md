Course Materials for YouTube course: I2C: Theory and Practice on Bare Metal STM32
=================================================================================

This repo contains course materials for my YouTube course **I2C: Theory and
Practice on Bare Metal STM32**. This course consists of five videos.

Currently this repo just contains documents (I2C specification, data sheets,
etc.) that can be found
[here](external-docs/README.md).

There is another repo containing the code for this course. The URL is:

https://github.com/g-schro/i2c-class-1-code

This course is a follow-on to my base course **Bare Metal Embedded Software
Development: Theory and Practice Using STM32**. The code in this repo is an
enhanced version of the code developed for that course. The YouTube URL for that
base course is:
